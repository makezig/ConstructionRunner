Project Name: Contruction Runner

Installation guide:
Download the .zip file and extract it into a folder. Then go in to the ConstructionRunner_MarkusTunturivuori folder and double-click on ConstructionRunner.exe.
Now the game should open.

Gameplay:
You play as a construction worker running and jumping over fences in a sidescroller game.
Spacebar works as the jump button and is the only button used during gameplay.
The goal of the game is to jump over as many fences as you can (this game requires a lot of patience).

Sound & Effects:
There is a sound effect when you jump or crash into an object.
There is background music.
A particle effect for running while touching ground and for hitting an obstacle.

UI:
Main menu with a play button to start the game, options button that takes you to the options menu and a quit button for quitting the game.
Game over screen with a restart button to start over and a main menu button to go back to the main menu.
In the top left corner there is a counter for how many obstacles have passed.
Menus can be navigated with mouse or arrow keys.

All of the assets except the UI and scripts are from Unity’s Prototype 3 StarterFiles.
UI assets were made in Krita. UI was made using TextMeshPro tools in Unity.

Scripts were mostly made by following Unity’s Create with Code Unit 3 – Sound and Effects tutorial. Scripts for menus and score system were made on by following youtube tutorials and I fixed a few bugs in caused by the code from Unity’s tutorials.
